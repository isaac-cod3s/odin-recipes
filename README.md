# odin-recipes
my first project in Foundations is called Recipes. Learning to use github and repositories is really fun.
this was a great first project to build a basic website, i definitely cant wait to do more.
I also had good practice from what i learned from Foundations so far, like boiler plates, headings, paragraphs, images, links, unordered and ordered lists. i am enjoying the journey so far and look forward to more challenges ahead.
