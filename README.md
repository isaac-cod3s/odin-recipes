# odin-recipes
my first project in Foundations is called Recipes
this was a fun first project to build a basic website, i definitely cant wait to do more.
i created a new repo in git hub and added a README.md and copied the ssh key to clone inside the repos folder. I also had good practice from what i learned from Foundations so far, like boiler plates, headings, paragraphs, images, links, unordered and ordered lists. i am enjoying the journey so far and look forward to more challenges ahead.
